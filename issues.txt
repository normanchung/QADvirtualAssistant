{Failing training data}
- "bill to to" is not being recognized as "bill to"
    - Example: "Edit [bill to](field) to [88C8888](customer_id) for sales order [SO111199](sale_order_id)"

{Incomplete functionalities}
- filter type defaulting to 'literal' -> need to handle 'field' type as well
- 'delete' actions are being redirected to 'read'

{Possible issues}
- 'customer' is being mapped to 'soldTo'
